Professional & Technical Overview

I’m easy-going and grounded—most comfortable in the woods, on the water, or working through a problem until it makes sense. I enjoy technology at a fundamental level: understanding how systems work, why they fail, and how to make them reliable, secure, and efficient. I approach problems methodically and value accuracy, clarity, and well-defined process.

I am a senior IT professional with experience across infrastructure, cloud, automation, and technology management. Microsoft Azure and Dynamics 365 Finance & Operations certified, with a proven record of improving business efficiency through automation, dependable infrastructure, and high-quality client and customer service.
