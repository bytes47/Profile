Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in opportunities within your organization. As an IT professional with broad experience across infrastructure, cloud platforms, enterprise systems, and automation, I have built my career around structuring complex technical environments into clear, stable, and user-focused systems that support real business outcomes.

As an Infrastructure Consultant supporting multiple Dynamics 365 development initiatives, I was responsible for designing and managing the infrastructure that bridged internal development teams and client production environments. This included integrating cloud-based solutions with existing client networks, architecting environments to support large-scale data frameworks such as Azure Data Lakes, and managing full lifecycle migrations from development through testing, pre-production, and production.

I configured and automated deployments using DevOps pipelines to standardize releases, reduce manual effort, and improve reliability across environments. My work required close collaboration with client technical teams to align data models, database structures, and infrastructure strategy with project goals. The focus was always on building scalable, maintainable systems that were reliable in production and intuitive for the teams supporting them.

My background includes formal certification and structured training across cloud platforms, enterprise systems, automation, and core IT support, complemented by leadership experience as Vice President of Student Council and instructional certification through the New Brunswick Talk About Teaching program. These experiences strengthened my ability to communicate clearly, coordinate stakeholders, and align technical execution with organizational objectives.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience may support your organization.

Sincerely,  
Jason McGinn
