# Guidelines for Using AI in Professional Document Development

When using AI to assist with professional document creation, effectiveness depends on how clearly and deliberately instructions are provided. AI should be treated as a productivity tool that responds to structured input, not as an authoritative source. The following guidelines outline a disciplined approach that improves accuracy, consistency, and reliability.

## 1. Establish Structure Before Writing
Begin by requesting a **bullet-point outline** of the subject matter.

Review the outline carefully and refine it point by point:
- Rewrite each item using your own expertise
- Verify any unfamiliar concepts independently
- Remove or correct items that do not align with your intent

This process ensures the document is grounded in human judgment before detailed content is generated.

## 2. Use Clear and Explicit Instructions
AI performs best when instructions are **direct and unambiguous**.

Prompts should clearly define:
- The purpose of the document
- The intended audience
- The required structure and format
- Any constraints or exclusions

In some cases, using AI to refine your instructions before issuing a final prompt can significantly improve the quality of the resulting output.

## 3. Define Constraints in Advance
State rules and expectations **before** requesting content generation. These should be provided in point form to reduce ambiguity.

Common constraints include:
- Tone and writing style
- Perspective (e.g., instructional, advisory, technical)
- Formatting requirements (e.g., Markdown, headings, bullet lists)
- Level of detail
- Source expectations or assumptions

Clearly defined constraints reduce inconsistencies and prevent unintended shifts in direction.

## 4. Use Reusable Instruction Templates
Develop and maintain **instruction templates** rather than creating new prompts for each task.

Templates:
- Promote consistency across documents
- Reduce the risk of conflicting or incomplete instructions
- Improve predictability of output
- Support repeatable workflows

Template-based prompting is a control mechanism, not a shortcut.

## 5. Reassert Context When Necessary
If the AI output begins to reflect incorrect assumptions or unintended context:
- Restate the applicable rules and objectives
- Explicitly instruct the AI to disregard prior instructions and focus on the current task

This approach reestablishes alignment without requiring a new session.

## 6. Core Competency
These practices form the foundation of **writing effective instructions for AI**, commonly referred to as *prompt engineering*.

At its core, this discipline focuses on:
- Deliberate input design
- Minimizing ambiguity
- Improving output reliability
- Maintaining human accountability for accuracy and intent
