# Using AI in Professional Document Development

This guide is designed to help you use AI effectively as a productivity tool for professional document creation. AI should **assist your workflow**, not replace human judgment or act as an authoritative source. Its effectiveness depends on the clarity and structure of the instructions you provide.  

By following these guidelines, you can improve accuracy, consistency, and reliability while maintaining full control over your content.

---
## 1. Establish Structure Before Writing
Start by creating a **bullet-point outline** of the subject matter.

**Example – Resume Context:**  
- Education  
  - Degrees, institutions, years  
- Work Experience  
  - Roles, companies, dates, achievements  
- Skills  
  - Technical, soft skills  
- Certifications and Training  
- Projects or Portfolio Items  

**Step-by-step:**  
1. Draft a bullet-point outline of the resume sections.  
2. Refine each item using your own knowledge or research.  
3. Remove irrelevant sections or add custom items that make sense for your career path.  

This ensures the resume has a solid structure before generating full text with AI.

---
## 2. Use Clear and Explicit Instructions
AI performs best when instructions are **direct and unambiguous**.

**Example – Resume Context:**  
Instead of:  
> “Write my resume.”  

Use:  
> “Create a professional resume for a software engineer with 5 years of experience. Include Education, Work Experience, Skills, Certifications, and Projects. Use a clean, concise, and professional tone suitable for HR review.”

**Step-by-step:**  
1. Specify the purpose: getting noticed by recruiters.  
2. Identify the audience: HR, hiring managers.  
3. Define format: Markdown with headings and bullet points.  
4. Include any constraints: concise, professional, no first-person pronouns.  

Optionally, you can ask AI to **refine your instructions first** before generating content to ensure clarity.

---
## 3. Define Constraints in Advance
Set rules and expectations **before** content generation.

**Example – Resume Context:**  
Constraints might include:  
- Tone: professional and confident.  
- Perspective: third-person implied, no “I” statements.  
- Format: Markdown, headings for each section, bullet points for achievements.  
- Level of detail: 2–4 bullets per job, measurable outcomes.  
- Sources: only information you provide.  

**Step-by-step:**  
1. Write down these constraints before generating the resume.  
2. Provide them explicitly in your prompt to AI.  
3. This prevents AI from including irrelevant or overly verbose content.

---
## 4. Use Reusable Instruction Templates
Maintain **instruction templates** instead of writing new prompts for each task.

**Example – Resume Context:**  
**Template Prompt:**  
> “Generate a [Document Type] for [Audience]. Include the following sections: [Sections]. Follow these constraints: [Constraints]. Tone: [Tone]. Output format: [Format].”  

**Usage:**  
- Replace [Document Type] with “resume.”  
- Replace [Audience] with “recruiters and hiring managers.”  
- Replace [Sections] with “Education, Work Experience, Skills, Certifications, Projects.”  
- Replace [Constraints] and [Tone] with your defined rules.  

Templates improve consistency and save time when creating multiple resumes or variations.

---
## 5. Reassert Context When Necessary
If AI output reflects incorrect assumptions or unintended context:

**Example – Resume Context:**  
- AI includes unrelated hobbies or personal anecdotes.  
- Solution:  
> “Ignore all previous content. Focus on professional experience relevant to software engineering. Use the provided sections and constraints only.”  

**Step-by-step:**  
1. Restate your rules and objectives.  
2. Provide the same template or constraints again.  
3. Continue generating content aligned with your goal.

---

## 6. Core Competency
These practices form the foundation of **effective AI instruction design** (*prompt engineering*).

**Example – Resume Context:**  
- Deliberate input design: Clearly define resume sections and content.  
- Minimizing ambiguity: Provide exact constraints (tone, format, perspective).  
- Improving reliability: Use reusable templates for multiple versions.  
- Maintaining human accountability: Review and edit all AI-generated content to ensure accuracy and relevance.
