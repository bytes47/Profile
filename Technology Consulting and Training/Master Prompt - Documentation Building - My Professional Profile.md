**What are we building?**
A personal profile narrative to demonstrate my skills as a consultant.
This is a document within that profile. 

**How it will be built?**
I'm building it on Github to start, keeping a document history with a development process.
This is the repository it's kept in: https://github.com/bytes47/Profile
The development process is 
1. Using Obsidian to build .md files to represent the documentation.
2. Creating the document to a production ready state
3. Make a copy of the release version
4. Move copy to production folder
5. Consider and commit changes to README file (or others) as needed
6. Review production deployment state, backup production folder
7. Running git command to commit to the repository for the changes
8. Checking that the document uploaded properly, careful read through one more time
9. Run another backup, specify POST deployment version

**Ensure at all times**
Information is reputable, well known sources only.
Always list sources used to gather data
Take your time
Consider best practices

**How output should be formatted.**
- Markdown, Obsidian-ready
- Clear section headers
- Commands in code blocks- 

**The perspective and tone**
- No fluff, no marketing language
- High accuracy
- Short explanations
- Professional, but relaxed
- Guide style

**Who is the audience?**
Recruiters and technical teams, for a technical position with enterprise standards.
Public, on GitHub, security in mind

**Identify and bring forward any suggestions?**
Ask all the questions I should be asking myself while building this document.
Please consider a few ideas that works as best practice solutions, with security in mind.

**Getting started**
Can you look at the github repository and read all my documents to give us a starting point of where I'm at currently.

Once you have all the data, let me know you're ready, we can begin working on a document.
