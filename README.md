## 🧭 Professional Focus

Work centers on designing and supporting systems that are **practical, secure, and maintainable**:
- **Infrastructure & Cloud** – appliances, servers, virtualization, and cloud platforms  
- **Automation & Tooling** – scripting, workflow orchestration, and operational efficiency  
- **Data & Reporting** – SQL-driven insights, reporting, and business-facing data solutions  
- **Security & Networking** – layered controls, firewall policy, and enterprise networking  
- **Monitoring, Operations & Backups** – visibility, alerting, fault isolation, and data protection  
- **Documentation & Training** – materials that reduce friction and improve system understanding  

Design philosophy: build systems that are **clear, resilient, and understandable under pressure**.
